<p>I'm currently learning how to construct functional websites and upload them online. I acquired some knowledge of AutoCad after taking a community college course on it in the spring of 2021. I worked as a student employee in the food service at CCSU for sodexo during the time I was in a school district college prep bridges program upon graduating high school in 2018. I have learned over the past couple of years to be a rather decent researcher in the realms of Conspiracies and problems in our society. I want to tap that into researching and implementing the solutions that we need to build a better world for the future.</p>

    <p>My ultimate plans are to become an entreprenur and own a farm that will enable me to run a food store that sells locally fresh food products to customers. I also intend on owning a collection of classic cars in a garage collection and I intend on gearheading as a hobby. Most importantly I will raise a family in a matter that empowers them to be able to have important traits and help produce a better society in the long term future. </p>
